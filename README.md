Write the body of a function that operates a vending machine according to the problem description and its docstring.

 

This vending machine has nine buttons on its keypad, from 1 to 9.
The top row of the keypad is 7, 8, 9.
Items in the top row of the keypad cost $1.50, all other items cost $1.25.
When the customer arrives, item 6 is out of stock, all other items have five in stock.
The customer must press a valid keypad button, pay enough money, and have enough items left in order to get something from the vending machine.
Print the message "Selected a valid item." or "Selected an invalid item." depending on whether the customer selected a valid item number.
If the customer selected a valid item number, print the message "Payment was enough." or "Payment was not enough." depending on whether the customer paid enough money for the item.
Print the message "Here is your item." or "You get nothing." depending on whether the customer ultimately gets the item they wanted.
